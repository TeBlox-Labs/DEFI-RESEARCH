# Token Swap Route Selection and Execution

This guide explains the process of selecting tokens, extracting token addresses, identifying swap routes by preparing combinations, and using these routes to determine the best swap path for decentralized exchanges (DEX).

## Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** and **npm**: Ensure you have these installed for running scripts and managing packages.
2. **Infura**: Sign up for an Infura account to get a project ID for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
3. **Web3.js**: Familiarity with Web3.js for blockchain interaction and Solidity for understanding smart contracts.

## Step 1: Select Tokens and Extract Token Addresses

1. **Select Tokens**: Identify the tokens you want to swap.
   - **Input Token**: The token you want to swap from (e.g., VELO).
   - **Output Token**: The token you want to receive (e.g., OPTIMISM).
   - **Intermediate Tokens**: Tokens that can serve as intermediaries in the swap (e.g., USDC, DAI, ETH).

2. **Extract Token Addresses**: Obtain the contract addresses of these tokens from reliable sources such as Etherscan or the token's official documentation.
   - **VELO**: `0xVeloTokenAddress`
   - **USDC**: `0xUsdcTokenAddress`
   - **DAI**: `0xDaiTokenAddress`
   - **ETH**: `0xEthTokenAddress`
   - **OPTIMISM**: `0xOptimismTokenAddress`

## Step 2: Query the DEX for Available Pools

1. **Factory Contract**: Use the DEX's factory contract to fetch information about all available liquidity pools.
   - **Function to Use**: Typically, functions like `allPairs` and `allPairsLength` in the factory contract.
   - **Action**: Retrieve the list of all pair addresses managed by the factory contract.

2. **Fetch Pairs**: Iterate through the list of pairs to get their addresses.
   - **Data Collection**: Collect addresses of all liquidity pools.

## Step 3: Fetch Tokens in Each Pool

1. **Pair Contract**: For each pair address, use the pair contract to fetch the tokens that form the pair.
   - **Function to Use**: Functions like `token0` and `token1` in the pair contract.
   - **Action**: For each pair, determine the two tokens that are paired together.

2. **Token Pairs Collection**: Create a list of token pairs with their respective addresses.
   - **Output**: A structured list containing each pair's address and the two tokens it pairs.

## Step 4: Construct Potential Routes

1. **Identify Direct Routes**:
   - **Direct Swap Check**: Check if there is a direct liquidity pool between the input token and the output token.
   - **Add Direct Route**: If a direct pool exists, add it to the list of potential routes.

2. **Identify Intermediate Routes**:
   - **Intermediate Tokens**: Use tokens like USDC, DAI, and ETH as intermediaries.
   - **Route Construction**: For each intermediate token, construct routes that go from the input token to the intermediate token, and then from the intermediate token to the output token.
   - **Route Examples**:
     - VELO -> USDC -> OPTIMISM
     - VELO -> DAI -> OPTIMISM
     - VELO -> ETH -> OPTIMISM

3. **Combine Routes**: Combine direct and intermediate routes into a comprehensive list of potential swap paths.

## Step 5: Validate Liquidity and Feasibility

1. **Check Liquidity**: For each route, validate the liquidity of each pool involved.
   - **Function to Use**: Functions like `getReserves` in the pair contract to check the reserves of the tokens in the pool.
   - **Criteria**: Ensure that each pool has sufficient liquidity to handle the swap amount.

2. **Validate Routes**: Confirm that each route is feasible based on the liquidity information.
   - **Invalid Routes**: Discard routes with insufficient liquidity or any other issues.
   - **Valid Routes**: Keep routes that are feasible and have enough liquidity.

## Step 6: Use Routes to Call `getAmountsOut`

1. **Router Contract**: Use the DEX's router contract to simulate the swap and get the output amounts.
   - **Function to Use**: The `getAmountsOut` function in the router contract.
   - **Inputs**: Provide the input amount and the list of routes.

2. **Simulate Swap**: For each valid route, simulate the swap to determine the output amount.
   - **Output Amounts**: Capture the final output amount for each route.

3. **Compare Outputs**: Compare the output amounts of all routes to determine the best route.
   - **Best Route Selection**: Select the route that provides the highest final output amount.

## Example Workflow

1. **Initialize**: Set up the environment, including Web3.js and your Infura project ID.
2. **Select Tokens**: Define the tokens and their addresses.
3. **Fetch Pairs**: Retrieve all pairs from the factory contract.
4. **Fetch Token Pairs**: Determine the tokens in each pair.
5. **Construct Routes**: Create potential swap routes.
6. **Validate Routes**: Check liquidity and validate the routes.
7. **Simulate Swaps**: Use the router contract to simulate swaps for each route.
8. **Select Best Route**: Compare outputs and select the most efficient route.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can programmatically determine the best swap route on a DEX. This process involves selecting tokens, extracting their addresses, identifying all possible routes, validating these routes based on liquidity, and simulating the swap to find the optimal path.
